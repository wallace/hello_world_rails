## README

This is an example of using Ruby 2.0 Tracepoint API to measure the amount of
ruby and C method calls using rails.

Inspired by [Mark Bate's](https://twitter.com/markbates) [rubyconf presentation on tracepoint](http://www.slideshare.net/markykang/mangling-ruby-withtracepoint). Derived from [his code in the same talk](https://gist.github.com/markbates/7403345). Thanks [Mark](http://metabates.com/).
